## Task: 
        - Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even
        - The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game
        - When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
        - The event should be listenable from outside the component
        - When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))
        - A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the 
          Even Component (on even numbers)
        - Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
        - Style the element  holding your output text differently in both components
